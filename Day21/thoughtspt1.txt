"mxmxvkd" kfcds "sqjhc" nhms (contains dairy, fish)
trh fvjkl "sbzzf" "mxmxvkd" (contains dairy)
"sqjhc" fvjkl (contains soy)
"sqjhc" "mxmxvkd" sbzzf (contains fish)

answer:
none of the ingredients kfcds, nhms, sbzzf, or trh can contain an allergen. 

if the two sets contain the same allergens, any common items could contain the allergens
if the two sets do not contain the same allergen, any common items should not contain the allergens

Compare all foods that contain the same allergen
All common ingredients in these foods may contain that allergen
Add all of these to the probable allergens sets
